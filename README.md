# Project Turing
## Goal
Exploring machine learning and deep learning algorithm implementations using Numpy and Pytorch

## Getting Started
This section describes the preqrequisites, and contains instructions, to get the project up and running.

### Usage
To setup a Conda environment with all the prerequisite packages used in the project, do the following:
  1. Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) and run the downloaded shell script using the command: `$ bash conda_install.sh`
  2. Create a conda environment from the included `environment.yml` file using the following command:
     
     `$ conda env create -f environment.yml`
  3. Activate the environment
     
     `$ conda activate turing`

## Contributing Guidelines
There are no specific guidelines for contributing, apart from a few general guidelines we tried to follow, such as:
* Code should follow PEP8 standards as closely as possible
* Use a linter like `pylint`, trying to push to a score as close to 10 as possible.
* Use [Google-Style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) to document the Python modules in this project.

If you see something that could be improved, send a pull request! 
We are always happy to look at improvements and new experiments, to ensure that `turing`, as a project, is the best version of itself. 

If you think something should be done differently (or is just-plain-broken), please create an issue.
